## Install

macOS desktop app + terminal command:

```bash
brew install --cask vincelwt/tap/gloomberb
# or
curl -fsSL gloomberb.com/install | bash
```

Both install `Gloomberb.app` and a `gloomberb` terminal command that runs the TUI through the app bundle, so the Bun runtime is stored once.

Desktop-only download:

- [Download Gloomberb for Mac](https://gloomberb.com/download/desktop)

Terminal-only install:

```bash
bun install -g gloomberb
```

Then run:

```bash
gloomberb
```

On macOS, app updates replace the app bundle in place and keep the terminal command pointing at the updated bundle. Homebrew users can also update through `brew upgrade --cask gloomberb`.

For the best terminal experience, use a [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)-compatible terminal such as Ghostty, Kitty, or WezTerm.

## Start

Open command mode with `Ctrl+P`, then type a command. Press `` ` `` to open ticker search directly.

| Try | Opens |
|-----|-------|
| `DES AAPL` | Security details |
| `GP NVDA` | Price chart |
| `TOP` | Ranked market stories |
| `MOST` | Market movers |
| `PF` | Portfolios and watchlists |
| `HELP` | Full in-app shortcut list |

## What It Does

- Research companies with quotes, charts, financials, filings, holders, insiders, options, analyst ratings, events, and relative valuation.
- Follow markets with top stories, breaking news, sector feeds, Substack subscriptions, global indices, FX, macro events, yield curves, market movers, and fear/greed.
- Track portfolios and watchlists, connect brokers, set alerts, keep notes, run AI screens, browse prediction markets, and use Gloom Cloud chat.

## CLI

Running `gloomberb` with no arguments launches the terminal UI. Normal commands run through a headless CLI path; use `gloomberb launch-ui` when a script should explicitly open the UI.

Human-readable output is the default. Automation can opt into structured output with `--json`, `--csv`, or `--ndjson`. JSON output favors the richest fetched model available and includes display-column metadata when a command has table columns; CSV and NDJSON use the command's tabular row view. Common global flags include `--limit`, `--refresh`, `--quiet`, `--no-color`, `--dry-run`, and `--yes`.

Commands that need a signed-in cloud session may return `auth_required`; sign-in, account management, and chat workflows are still handled in the app UI for now.

## Plugins

Everything from the portfolio list to broker integrations is a plugin. Plugins can add panes, tabs, columns, command bar commands, CLI commands, status bar widgets, and data providers.

Core plugin areas include:

- Portfolios, watchlists, manual entry, and broker connections
- Ticker details, quotes, charts, options, filings, holders, insiders, and research
- News, Substack reader feeds, market movers, global indices, sectors, FX, earnings, macro data, and yield curves
- Prediction markets, alerts, notes, chat, AI screeners, and external plugins

See [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for the plugin API and the shared UI surface available through `gloomberb/components`.
